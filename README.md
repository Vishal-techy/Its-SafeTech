## Team Name
It's SafeTech 

## Idea
An innovative healthcare app integrates accident detection, facial and fingerprint scanning with machine learning for emergency response, medical data access, and environmental assessment. It streamlines hospital registration, enables remote prescriptions and insurance management, ensuring holistic well-being with voice-based SOS and automated services. 

## Features 
1. Our App works by scanning your face (or) fingerprint by the healthcare professionals ,it uses the advanced technology CNN, which initiates emergency calls to predefined contacts.It also employs mobile sensor data fed to our custom-trained ML model, swiftly detecting accidents and alerting healthcare services with precise location and personal details.

2. For added security, a personalized QR code is generated, allowing emergency contacts to access your medical information when face and fingerprint scans are impractical. In case of uncertainty, the app also employs custom-made CNN models to assess the environment for potential emergencies before authorizing scans.

3. It goes beyond emergencies; it revolutionizes medical record accessibility. Upon admission to a hospital, doctors can access your complete medical history by scanning face/fingerprint, or entering a unique patient ID. This ensures a seamless and secure transfer of vital information. It strictly limits access to verified healthcare professionals, protecting your privacy.

4. It avoids the paperwork delay â€“ doctors can complete patient application forms with a single click. The app prompts doctors during the scanning process, automatically filling in details and streamlining the hospital registration process.

5. Worried about unauthorized scans? Our app logs every instance, allowing users to track access and take legal action. Access your medical history seamlessly, and securely store records by scanning copies into the app, protected in IPFS private blockchain networks.

6. Beyond emergencies, our app supports virtual patient monitoring. Doctors can remotely check your health post-discharge prescribe medications, and buy it and recommend personalized diet plans based on your medical history. The app even monitors your physical activities, providing real-time alerts if you exceed safe limits, ensuring your continued well-being.
